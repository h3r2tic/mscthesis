\section{Mental and hardware programming model mismatch}

We'd ideally want to work with geometry displacement, surface properties and light emission, not vertices and pixels.

Would like to work just on pixels, but vertex shaders must feed data to them and computations may be moved to the vertex stage for performance reasons.

Some stuff nicely done in vertex shaders, such as skinning.

Would like to work with materials, surfaces, lights

\section{Shader permutation management}

 We can map the mental model into the GPU model, but that requires some automation. Few systems make it workable.
